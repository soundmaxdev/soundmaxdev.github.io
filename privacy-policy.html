              I want to inform you that whenever you
              use my Service, in a case of an error in the app
              I collect data and information (through third party
              products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
              include information such as your device Internet Protocol
              (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the

            </p>
            <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
            <p>
              Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
              commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
              to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
              stored on your device's internal memory.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
              the app may use third party code and libraries that use
              “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
              You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
              and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
              choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some

            <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
            <p>
              I may employ third-party companies and
              individuals due to the following reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
              <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
              <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
              <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I want to inform users of this Service
              that these third parties have access to your Personal
              Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
              them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
              disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

            <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
            <p>
              I value your trust in providing us your
              Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
              acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
              of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
              storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
              guarantee its absolute security.

              a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
              that these external sites are not operated by me.

            <p>
              These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
              I do not knowingly collect personally
              identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
              I discover that a child under 13 has provided
              me with personal information, I immediately
              delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
              and you are aware that your child has provided us with
              personal information, please contact me so that
              I will be able to do necessary actions.
